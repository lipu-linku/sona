[translations]
commentary = '"ali" is an alternative to "ale", coined in a poll in 2002 in order to avoid confusion with "ala". However, the usage of "ale" over "ali" has been more common since at least the release of pu. Generally not considered a word in its own right.'
definition = "[pronunciation variant of ale]"
etymology = "alle: Dutch, all"
