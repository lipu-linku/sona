Meant to be used alongside a nasin that does not use either ike or pona to express value judgements (especially morality). These words are often used in a way that ignores the reasoning behind the judgement. The goal of this experimental nasin is to promote mindfulness about value itself, translating mere reaction into introspection and explanation. ⚠️ Because of the stated attachment to this particular nasin pi toki pona, it should be noted that using salu and pona/ike as good/bad at the same time goes against the point of the word's creation, and that salu is redundant in this circumstance. If you are using one, you should not use the other.","definition":"comfort, security, safety, stability; attention, care, caution","etymology":"salus: Latin, safety, security","sp_etymology":""},"samu":{"commentary":"Coined in reference to jan Samu, a Facebook user who attempted to propose a new word.","definition":"Να θες να φτιάχνεις καινούριο κόσμο","etymology":"jan Samu: toki pona, jan Samu","sp_etymology":""},"sapelipope":{"commentary":"","definition":"fiddlesticks!, damn","etymology":"saperlipopette: French","sp_etymology":""},"se":{"commentary":"","definition":"το ψηφίο 4","etymology":"四/肆 (sei): Cantonese, 4","sp_etymology":""},"se1":{"commentary":"","definition":"one's own","etymology":"se: Latin, oneself","sp_etymology":""},"sikako":{"commentary":"sikeko is a common misspelling from tokiponists who believe \"sikako\" derives from \"sike ko\".","definition":"snail, gastropods, or “similar” animals","etymology":"escargot: French, escargot","sp_etymology":""},"sikomo":{"commentary":"Coined in reference to the Travis Scott song ‘Sicko Mode’.","definition":"Σε υψηλότερη βαθμίδα, διαφωτισμένη, σε εξαιρετικά μεγάλο βαθμό","etymology":"sicko mode: English, sicko mode","sp_etymology":""},"silapa":{"commentary":"Customarily written on multiple lines with a long \"neck\" composed of the letter \"i\" (originally the first \"a\"), like so:\nsi\n i\n ilapa","definition":"giraffe","etymology":"żyrafa: Polish, giraffe","sp_etymology":""},"sipi":{"commentary":"Proposed on a forum and quickly forgotten.
