commentary = "An earliest instance of this glyph exists primarily by coincidence. It does depict the lape glyph, but the intention of the author seems to be to draw a face on the mu glyph, as opposed to representing the word lape with a new glyph. https://discord.com/channels/301377942062366741/301377942062366741/811689197504823306 "
