author_verbatim = """.. ja2 **ja** - *post-ku*: marks the end of a preverb (or preposition, with lu)

Makes it possible to make anything into a preverb without ambiguity.
> *mi tawa telo e kasi*: I'm moving a plant towards water.
> *mi tawa ja telo e kasi*: I'm going (in order) to water the plants.
Can be used to make composite preverbs by including multiple words before the ja.
> *mi wile mute ja sona e ni*: I really want to know this.
Can be stacked.
> *mi open ja olin ja telo e kasi*: I'm starting to love watering the plants.
Can optionally be used with existing preverbs to clarify them.
> *mi wile ja kama ja sona* = *mi wile kama sona.*
> *mi olin ja kama ja sona e ijo sin* = *mi olin ja kama sona e ijo sin* = I love to learn new things.
All preverbs before the last ja should be marked by ja.
> *mi wile ja tawa ja tawa musi* ≠ *mi wile tawa ja tawa musi.*

Can be used with lu (see `... lu`) to make composite prepositions.
> *soko li lu ante mute ja leko*: Mushrooms are very different to squares.
> *mi pali e ni lu kepeken wawa ja luka mi*: I made this by vigorously using my hands.
> *pakala ni li kama lon lu kepeken pi ike lili ja ilo kule*: This mess was made via somewhat bad usage of a paintbrush."""
