author_verbatim = "alright everone, i've come to nimisin. except it's not just any nimisin, it's one that i've put a bit of work into and have grown very fond of.\n\nnimi: onono\nmeaning: emergency, attention, urgent; primarily an interjection\nsitelen: triangle with exclamation point\n\nwhile one could use it as a content word, the main purpose of onono is as an interjection at the beginning of a sentence, especially to call attention and convey a sense of urgency. in a way, it's a \"set the context\" nimi more than a \"has a meaning\" nimi. ideally, this nimi is useful as rarely as possible. but like a fire extinguisher, you would have it in case you need it, not because you use it often enough.\n\nthere are certainly plenty other ways that you could describe an onono situation without onono, but that's not the point. the point of the nimi is that having a single word that is immediately recognizable is extra beneficial in that particular situation, especially with how context would be as against you as it gets in that moment.\n\ni've already been using onono in my works the past several months (albeit not many times due to its nature) and i really like it so far. it just feels to me that \"emergency\" is one of the most important things to be able to communicate, so it would make sense to have a dedicated word for that purpose, no matter how narrow that purpose is.\n\nand of course, obviously don't use conlangs in an actual emergency. though if you were in a tpt environment, onono can also convey \"what i'm about to say is probably really important so don't jump to kokosila'ing me if i start using a different language.\"\n\n(if i don't respond it's because i used up all my spoons battling my \"presenting creation\" anxiety and \"public discord\" anxiety)"
